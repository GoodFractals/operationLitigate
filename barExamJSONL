Hank’s 2017 codicil, executed by Sid as his conservator, attempted to give a one-half interest in the house to Hank’s best friend, Bill. California recognizes wills and codicils properly executed under the law of the state where they were made. Because Sid, as conservator, had the legal authority to modify Hank’s will and the codicil was properly witnessed, the bequest to Bill is valid.

Here, Hank transferred $100,000 from an inheritance into a revocable trust, naming himself as the lifetime income beneficiary, Wendy as the successor income beneficiary, and Sid as the remainder beneficiary. Because Hank retained the right to receive income during his lifetime, creditors could have reached the trust assets while he was alive.

Although QCP is treated as the acquiring spouse’s separate property during their lifetime, a non-acquiring spouse can recover one-half of the transferred property if it was gifted without their consent and certain conditions apply.

Under California’s clawback provision, any inter vivos transfer of QCP that includes a retained right of survivorship is subject to the surviving spouse’s claim.

Dan’s statement was made to Paul’s class and implied he had cheated, meeting defamation elements. IIED requires extreme and outrageous conduct, severe emotional distress, and causation.

Additionally, since Dan used Paul's name and referred to him as a 'two-bit actor,' it was clear he was referring to Paul. The statement was published to third parties (the class), and it was false.
